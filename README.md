## How to Build and Run from Source (Windows)
1. You must have GCC installed. An installation and setup guide can be found [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-gcc-windows).
2. Download the zipped archive of this repository
3. Unzip the archive
4. Open the resulting folder in the command prompt
5. Enter the command `./run` to start the run.bat batch script. This both builds the code into a main.exe executable and runs it.
